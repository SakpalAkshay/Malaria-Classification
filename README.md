Utilized **Resnet 50** to develop a **Malaria detection system**

Model is trained on Parasitic and Non Parasitic Images, utilizes resnet 50 to acutally detect parasite present in the red blood cells images.

**Static** - contains testing images

**app.py** - Entry point to application 

**Templates** - Has HTML files to interact with the application

**resnet** - Contains the RESNET 50 Architecture model

**model** - contains data presprocessing for images and utilizes resnet 50

**Note** - You need to have flask and other Computer Vision libraries enabled to run this project.
